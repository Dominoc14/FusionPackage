# FusionPackage
## What is FusionBackage ? 
FusionPackage is a Fusion 360 Add-in made with the Fusion 360's API. 

The main goal of this Add-in is to regroup all the script you need, under one roof.
It regroups some original script and script from others like [AutodeskFusion360](https://github.com/AutodeskFusion360).

Once you install the FusionBackage Add-in to Fusion 360, a wonderful new tab appears after the "UTILIES" tab in Fusion 360.
This marvellous tab contain panels of all sort.

The advantage of having all those scripts and add-in under one big add-in is to uniformise the practices across a company. 

In short, FusionPackage is a convivial way to ensure all Fusion 360 users of an organisation use the same add-in to streamline their work. 

## Installation 
Fortunately, [AutodeskFusion360](https://github.com/AutodeskFusion360) has already made a nice tutorial on how to install Add-in into fusion 360.
You can find it [here](https://rawgit.com/AutodeskFusion360/AutodeskFusion360.github.io/master/Installation.html).
