# FusionPackage
## What is FusionBackage ? 
FusionPackage is a Fusion 360 Add-in made with the Fusion 360's API. 

The main goal of this Add-in is to regroup all the script you need, under one roof.
It regroups some original script and script from others like [AutodeskFusion360](https://github.com/AutodeskFusion360).

Once you install the FusionBackage Add-in to Fusion 360, a wonderful new tab appears after the "UTILIES" tab in Fusion 360.
This marvellous tab is containing panels of all sort. One is relative to 3D printed part and another one contains function to help you maintain a clean CAD assembly. 

The advantage of having all those scripts and add-in under one big add-in is to uniformise the practices across a company. 

Let's say that for part identification you want all the designers to engrave the part number on all 3D printed part. 
What's the simplest way to make sure all the engraving will print properly and that they will look consistent? 
You can build a wiki that describe precisely what you want but you could also make an add-in that will streamline the designer work and ensure all the engraving will look the same. That's exactly what Engrave3D is for. 

In short, FusionPackage is a convivial way to ensure all Fusion 360 users of an organisation use the same add-in to streamline their work. 

## Installation 
Fortunately, [AutodeskFusion360](https://github.com/AutodeskFusion360) has already made a nice tutorial on how to install Add-in into fusion 360.
You can find it [here](https://rawgit.com/AutodeskFusion360/AutodeskFusion360.github.io/master/Installation.html).
